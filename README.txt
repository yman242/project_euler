This repository is to hold my solutions for Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net). For those who don't know what this is, it's basically a bunch of fun little programming problems. A friend of mine said all the solutions should generate their answers in less than a minute and I'm going to try and stick by it, but that's by no means a rule.

I can program in a number of languages but for this I'll likely stick to C++.
