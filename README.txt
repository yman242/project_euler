This repository is to hold my solutions for Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net). For those who don't know what this is, it's basically a bunch of fun little programming problems. A friend of mine said all the solutions should generate their answers in less than a minute and I'm going to try and stick by it, but that's by no means a rule.

The reason I'm doing this is I decided I needed to code more than just the little things my university was making me do, but lacked the time for a real project. I also needed to start showing things on my GitHub. So, I've decided to try and solve one of these a weekday. The first few problems are easy, but I figure that might help me get a rhythm going. I don't know if I'll be able to stick to my plan of one a day, what with life and university workloads, but I'm going to give it a try.

I can program in a number of languages but for this I'll likely stick to C++.

Anyone looking at these who hasn't done the problems themselves please don't just take my answer, you're depriving yourself the fun of solving it.

Anyone who sees a problem or a way to make these more efficient, please comment! I'm not so arrogant to assume my solutions are going to be the best.
